# eigenBounds
Code implementing the computation of bounds on eigenvalues/singular values of a matrix.
Work in progress.


# TO DO on Gao implementation:
1) Check if PRbound is implemented properly
2) See if periodic/pseudo-periodic signals can also use the factorization of covariance trick to get a bound
(periodic signals naturaly have a dimensionality bound, but they do not fit within the given framework)
3) See if results can be extended to  circulant matrices 
(i.e. periodic auto-correlations which do not taper off as time goes to infinity)
